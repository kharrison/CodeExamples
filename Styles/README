Styles

Version 1.0 24 August 2012    Initial Version
=======================================================================

The Styles App is an example of how to use the UIAppearance protocol to
customise the appearance of common UIKit controls.

For further details see:

=======================================================================
App Delegate
=======================================================================

UYLAppDelegate.h
UYLAppDelegate.m

The App delegate is largely unmodified from the template code. The use of
a storyboard to configure and load the UI means there is not much for the
app delegate to do in this simple app other than setup the appearance.

=======================================================================
Style Controller
=======================================================================

The core of the appearance code is contained in the custom UYLStyleController
class. This class has a single public class method +applyStyle which
contains all of the UIAppearance related code. Refer to the blog post
for a full description.

=======================================================================
Views
=======================================================================

MainStoryboard.storyboard

The storyboard file defines the user interface for the application. It 
uses a navigation controller with a static table view as the root view
to list each of the UIKit control views.

UYLOkButton.h
UYLOkButton.m
UYLResetButton.h
UYLResetButton.m
UYLZeroButton.h
UYLZeroButton.m

These classes are UIButton sub-classes that do nothing other than define
a custom subclass used to allow the appearance of specific buttons to be
modified.

=======================================================================
Controllers
=======================================================================

UYLListViewController.h
UYLListViewController.m

This is a subclass of UITableViewController used for the static table view
containing the list of UIKit controls. The only method that the subclass
actually contains is to enable interface rotation.

UYLRotatingViewController.h
UYLRotatingViewController.m

This is a container class used for all of the UIKit control views. The viewDidLoad method is used to set the view background. It also implements
the standard method to enable interface orientation.

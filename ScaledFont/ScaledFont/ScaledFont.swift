/// A utility class to help you use custom fonts with
/// dynamic type.
///
/// To use this class you must supply the name of a style
/// dictionary for the font when creating the class. The
/// style dictionary should be stored as a property list
/// file in the main bundle.
///
/// The style dictionary contains an entry for each text
/// style that uses the raw string value for each
/// `UIFontTextStyle` as the key.
///
/// The value of each entry is a dictionary with two keys:
///
/// + fontName: A String which is the font name.
/// + fontSize: A number which is the point size to use
///             at the `.large` content size.
///
/// For example to use a 17 pt Noteworthy-Bold font
/// for the `.headline` style at the `.large` content size:
///
///     <dict>
///         <key>UICTFontTextStyleHeadline</key>
///         <dict>
///             <key>fontName</key>
///             <string>Noteworthy-Bold</string>
///             <key>fontSize</key>
///             <integer>17</integer>
///         </dict>
///     </dict>
///
/// You do not need to include an entry for every text style
/// but if you try to use a text style that is not included
/// in the dictionary it will fallback to the system preferred
/// font.
